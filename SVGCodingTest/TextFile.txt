I started this test project with ASP.net Razor Pages. It seemed like the best 
way to get an MVC-like environment without creeping into overkill. I then
decided to pass an object from c# in JSON to inline JS in the Razor Page. 
Other than C# and JS, most of the ASP.NET framework is new to me, so I had to 
teach myself as I attempted to complete the test. I had some trouble with the 
SVG rendering properly dynamically through the JS. I also used the third party 
frameworks LINQ, and Newtonsoft.JSON.
